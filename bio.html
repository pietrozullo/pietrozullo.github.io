							<h1>Biography</h1>

							<p> 
								My name is Pietro Zullo, I was born in Padua, Italy, in 1997. I have studied in a Liceum and afterward moved to Milan to start 
								my academic career at Bocconi University. After a fructuous but tumultuous year I decided to part my way with business studies. 
								Albeit interested in business administration I did feel the need to know how the things that in a future I was supposed to manage or sell 
								worked. This lead me to move to an Engineering Degree, particularly the bachelopr degree in MEchanical Engineering at University of Padua. 
								In the engineering, or natural sciences, world I could find what I was looking for: hard math and food for my endless curiosity. 
								In the last semester of my bachelor I was selected to partecipate in an exchange program with Boston Univeristy, Boston, Massachussets. 
								Although the exchange was cut short due to the COVID pandemic, during that time I could appreciate an international environment and thanks to the 
								class Introduction to Robotics (ME-246), fall in love with robotics. 
								I therefore decided to enroll in the MSc in Mechanical Engineering at ETH Zurich, where I anticipated, I could attend robotics classes from 
								some of the best roboticsts, and not, in the world. 
								ETH changed my life in many ways and I will always be thankful for that. 
								Much more happened and is happening at the moment, if you wish to know more about it, contact me.
